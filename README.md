### machine_learning
In this assignment, I build and evaluate several machine-learning models to predict credit risk using free data from LendingClub

#### Imbalance Learn Library
Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?<br>
The model with the best balance accuracy score was the SMOTE oversampling at 66.22%. 

Which model had the best recall score?<br>
The model with the best recall score was the combination model using SMOTEENN with .71 and .58 for high risk and low risk respectively.

Which model had the best geometric mean score?<br>
The model with best geometric mean score was SMOTE oversampling. The score was .64

#### Ensemble Learning
Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?<br>
The model with the best balanced accuracy score was Balanced Random Forest Classifier at 78.55%

Which model had the best recall score?<br>
The Balanced Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest recall score with .67 and .90 for high risk and low risk respectively.

Which model had the best geometric mean score?<br>
The model with the best geometric mean score was also balanced random forest classifier at .78

What are the top three features?<br>
